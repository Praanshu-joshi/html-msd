        <H2>About</H2>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is often hailed as one of the best cricketers to have played the game for many reasons. While some hail him for his match awareness, some love Dhoni for his unique style of doing things. The Ranchi-born cricketer is also the most successful captain for India as he won all the ICC trophies (which were there till the time he played) during his stint. But Dhoni’s genius is not limited to the cricket field only.</p>
        <p>           
        <p>The 41-year-old gives his fans many reasons to fall in love with him. His off-field antiques are often a talking point even after two years of Dhoni’s international retirement. The former India captain is hailed for his simplicity and many take inspiration from Dhoni on how to not let success get to your head.</p>
            
         <p>   Famous Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle recently narrated an incident that will make people fall in love with Dhoni even more. In a recent interview, when Bhogle was asked to name his favourite captain for the Indian cricket team, he gave two names. Bhogle picked Sourav Ganguly and MS Dhoni as his two best captains. He also revealed the reason behind his choice. During the same, Bhogle also revealed an anecdote when he was flattered by Dhoni’s simplicity. </p>
            
          <p>  “Nobody can give you that answer because captaincy varies depending on the conditions you are captaining in. When Sourav Ganguly became captain, you needed that kind of a person. When Rahul Dravid became captain, you needed that kind of a person. The two in different roles won’t have been good. Dhoni could not take India to the level Virat Kohli did in Test cricket but Virat Kohli has not been able to win a tournament as Dhoni did,” said Bhogle while answering the question on the Humans of Bombay YouTube channel.</p> 
            
           <p> “But purely for the impact, he’s had on people, Ganguly and Dhoni. Just for the impact, they had on people’s careers. Ganguly for nurturing a whole new generation of players and Dhoni, because he comes from another planet. His room is never locked, anybody in that team can walk in that room anytime. Room service will be ordered, there will be something there, and the room is never locked.</p>
            
           
           <p>  But you can never call him on the phone. I met him only once (socially) in all these years. He doesn’t carry a mobile phone. It was in Australia where a friend had invited him and I was there. My friend and I were sharing a flat at that time and we had dinner together. Suresh Raina was there, and Dhoni’s wife was there. When we finished, he picked up his plate and he knew that there were only two of us, so he washed it and put it back,” added Bhogle.</p>
